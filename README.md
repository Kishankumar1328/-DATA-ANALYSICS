Briefly introduce your project, emphasizing its goal and how it involves data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Analysis

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
  - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
  - Normalize or scale features and convert categorical variables.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Identify patterns, trends, and outliers using statistical and visualization techniques.

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Apply tests to validate hypotheses and conduct correlation analysis.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Create visual representations using plots and charts to communicate findings.

## Machine Learning

- **Types of Machine Learning:**
  - **Supervised Learning:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-Learning, DQN.

- **Steps in Machine Learning:**
  - Data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
